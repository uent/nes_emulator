# Go Version Update Note

## Requested Update
The original request was to update the project to Go 1.24.

## Implementation
The project has maintained the existing **Go 1.21** version.

## Reason
Attempts to update to newer versions resulted in errors:

1. First attempt with Go 1.24:
```
go: downloading go1.24 (linux/amd64)
go: download go1.24 for linux/amd64: toolchain not available
```

2. Second attempt with Go 1.22:
```
go: downloading go1.22 (linux/amd64)
go: download go1.22 for linux/amd64: toolchain not available
```

These errors indicate that neither Go 1.24 nor Go 1.22 are available in the current environment. Therefore, we've maintained the original Go 1.21 version to ensure the project remains functional.

## Additional Information
When Go 1.24 is officially released and becomes available, the go.mod file can be updated again to specify `go 1.24`.
